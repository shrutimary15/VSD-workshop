#**Day 1: BASICS OF OPEN SOURCE EDA, OPENLANE AND SKY 130 PDK**
  * Introduction to QFN 48 package,die,core and IPs
  * SOC design using OpenLANE
  * Simplified ASIC design
  * EDA tools
  * Lab: Import package of OpenLANE and run synthesis
  
  #**Day 2: IDEA OF FLOORPLAN AND PLACEMENT**
  * Utilization factor and aspect ratio, floor planning and preplaced cells, decoupling capacitors, power planning, pin placement
  * Library binding and placement
  * Cell Design Flow
  * Characterization flow
  
  
  # DAY 1:
  
  OPENLANE : OpenLANE is a open source VLSI flow from RTL to GDSII built across open source tools such as OPENROAD, Yosys, Magic, Fault, etc.
  
  SKY130A: The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit.
  
  The process begins with synthesis then followed by floor planning, power planning, placement, routing and static timing analysis. The figure below shows the flow diagram of     complete process.
